Things to do asap

1. Treechart: aka treemap is not connecting on main index.html (there is a blank space but nothing shows up) so I made a "Treechart Trial" folder to just try the chart by itself and it seems like the thing that is impacting the connection is my data.
2. Scatterplot: on it's own page, everything works and data connects. I want to know how to add annotations right on the bubbles vs. the hover state. And also to style like where the bubbles are different colors like on my original chart.
   2a. Connected scatterplot to main html page and there is an empty spot for where it is supposed to appear but it's not there.
3. Make the "Asian American" bars on both bar charts a different color. I think there would have to be a function that selects the Asian American bars as the highest values and then changes that color, but not sure how to do this because bar colors are coded in css and not javascript.
   3a. Don't know why text labels don't show up on Annual Household income bar chart...
4. Scatterplot: use inspector on go live to find the class of the tick marks and the x axis line. create a class on css file and make - display=none to make it disappear

Things to do later

1. Put the two bar charts next to each other and the pie charts underneath. Pie charts will be one straight line.
2. Make the bar charts and pie charts responsive so that when a user looks at it on mobile, the charts line up in one column vertically.
